-'not all return values are real' solution: create a variable and set the ReadLine equal to it and return the variable.
-I want to use a loop, so I can do multiple commands at one time. I don't want to inculde an entire interface into the for loop interval. I want to use writer.Write("{0}, i"}. 



What I've done: 
I've created an application with two layers of commands, and I want to genericize the TextByText Class into a Interface or class of some sort in order to be able to make an application that allows the create of new commands 

NEXT STEP
look up and figure out how I can edit the code in my app with my app
one possible way is to have my app copy itself and edit the new copy and then switch over to that new copy as the production environment
